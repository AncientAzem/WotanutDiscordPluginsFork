    <h2> What is this?</h2>
    <p> Let's say someone asks a stupid question, that could easily be solved by googling it, all you have to do is type /lmgt and then enter their question and they get a message telling them exactly where they can file their request (google). </p>

    <h2>Installation </h2>
    <p>This plugin is only available to vencord. As such, installation is managed through Settings -> Plugins and then enabling lmgt.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p> Vencord is by far one of (if not the) best discord mod i've seen so far, I wanted to get in early and add "my mark" to the project, as this plugin is found on almost every other mod, I thought i'd be the first to attempt this plugin and try it out.</p>
