    <h2> What is this?</h2>
    <p> This is a plugin that automatically removes trackers from supported urls. Notice when you go to twitter and you see a tweet you like, if you click the share button and you paste it in to discord there's a bunch of crap after the question mark. </p>

    <p>Well this is actually a bunch of tracking information so daddy elon can know what you're up to.</p>
    <p> <i> So I can just remove it right? </i></p>
    <p> Good luck with that one. </p>
    <p> Anyway for the sane of you among us, this plugin removes that crap for you, and for reddit too. </p>
